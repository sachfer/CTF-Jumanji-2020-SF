				<h2><center><b>Dig in deep to the Jumanji</b></h2></center>
			</br>
			<p>
				The corrupt archaeologist, Bravestone's former associate Professor <a href="https://jumanji.fandom.com/wiki/Russell_Van_Pelt" style="color:red">Russell Van Pelt</a>, wants to obtain a jewel, the <a href="https://jumanji.fandom.com/wiki/Jaguar%27s_Eye" style="color:red">"Jaguar's Eye"</a>, which he previously stole and was embedded with dark power that now allows him to telepathically manipulate "JUMANJI" animals to his will.</br>

				<br>In Brantford, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire" style="color:red">New Hampshire</a>, teenager Alex Vreeke receives a board game called Jumanji from his father who discovered it half buried in sand at the coast while jogging. Uninterested, Alex sets it aside, only to find it transformed into a video game cartridge later that night. Opting to play the game, he is suddenly sucked inside upon choosing a character. His disappearance results in his father becoming despondent and his home becoming known as the 'freak house' and falling into disrepair.</br>

				<br>Twenty years later in 2016, four <a href="pcap/capture_3.pcap"style="color:red" download> Brantford High School </a> students – rebellious Martha Kaply, shallow Bethany Walker, awkward Spencer Gilpin, and athlete Anthony "Fridge" Johnson – are sent to clean up the school's basement for detention. Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video game system, which he and Spencer decide to play and encourage the girls to join them. Upon starting the game, they are sucked into Jumanji, landing in a <a href="" style="color:red">jungle</a> as their chosen characters – Spencer as muscular explorer and archaeologist Dr. Xander "Smolder" Bravestone; Fridge as diminutive zoologist Franklin "Mouse" Finbar; Martha as commando and martial arts expert Ruby Roundhouse; and Bethany as male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography" style="color:red"> cartographer </a> and paleontologist Professor Sheldon "Shelly" Oberon.</br>

				<br>While coming to terms with their situation, the group find three marks on their arms denoting lives. Spencer theorizes that if they lose all three, they will die in real life. The group encounter the game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character" style="color:red"> non-player character guide, </a> Nigel Billingsley, who provides them with the game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative" style="color:red"> narrative </a> and their characters' backstories. The group learn that their goal is to end a curse on Jumanji, brought about by corrupt archaeologist Professor Russell Van Pelt after he stole a magic jewel called the <a href="pcap/capture_1.pcap"style="color:red" download>"Jaguar's Eye" </a> from its shrine and gained control of all the jungle's animals. Nigel hands Spencer the jewel, having stolen it from Van Pelt, and instructs the group to return it to a statue at the shrine and call out "Jumanji" to "lift the curse" and leave the game before driving off.</br>

				<br>Coping with their avatars, their "weaknesses", Van Pelt's men, and Spencer and Fridge's animosity towards one another, the group encounter <a href="" style="color:red">Alex</a> operating the fifth avatar – pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough – who takes them to a jungle house built by Alan Parrish, the game's previous player. Upon realizing his identity, the group is collectively shocked upon learning how long he has been trapped in the game (Alex thought he'd only been there a few months). Now with a common goal, the group vows to help Alex return home with them. Dealing with further problems while heading for the shrine, the group coordinate to overcome them. They eventually reach the shrine, but Van Pelt corners them. Working together, Fridge, <a href="https://jumanji.fandom.com/wiki/Bethany_Walker" style="color:red"> Bethany </a>, and Alex distract him while Spencer and Martha outmaneuver him with the game's mechanics, returning the jewel to the statue. Upon calling out Jumanji, the group destroy Van Pelt and, sharing a handshake with Nigel, return to the real world.</br>

				<br>Returning to the school <a href="pcap/capture_2.pcap"style="color:red" download> basement,</a> the foursome find Alex is not with them. While walking home, they unexpectedly find the <a href="" style="color:red">Vreeke home</a> restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. The group is greeted by Alex, now an adult, who explains he returned to 1996, which allowed him to lead a married life with children. His daughter is named after Bethany, who revived him with one of her lives in the game.</br>

				<br>The four students become friends after their experiences in the <a href="" style="color:red">game</a>, with Bethany becoming a better person, Spencer and Fridge patching things up, and Spencer starting a relationship with Martha. When the group hear Jumanji's drumbeats coming from the game <a href="" style="color:red">cartridge</a>, Fridge crushes it to prevent anyone else from playing it.</br>

				<br>Nigel stole the <a href="" style="color:red">Jewel</a> from Van Pelt and fled to seek aid from Dr. Bravestone and his companions. To escape the game, the players must return it to an enormous <a href="https://jumanji.fandom.com/wiki/Jaguar" style="color:red"> Jaguar Shrine </a> and call out the name of the game: "JUMANJI".
